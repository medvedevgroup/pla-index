/* This is an extremely reduced version of xxh64 that can only hash single
 * 64 bit values, consisting mostly of the "bit mixing" part of xxh64
 * (finalize()/avalanche()).
 *
 * This performs a little bit better than calling the original function on an
 * 8-byte slice because the compiler does not fully inline everything.
